This section explains how to create maps using SLAM Toolbox , how mapping works internally, and best practices for generating high-quality maps. Titan Robot performs 2D LIDAR-based SLAM using wheel odometry and laser scan data. SLAM Concepts What is SLAM? SLAM allows a robot to: - Build a map of an unknown environment - Estimate its own position within that map at the same time Titan Robot uses: - Laser scans from the 2D LIDAR - Odometry from wheel encoders These inputs are fused by SLAM Toolbox to continuously update the map. Inputs Used for SLAM Input Source Laser scans 2D LIDAR ( /scan ) Odometry ESP32 encoder-based odometry ( /odom ) TF Robot frame transforms SLAM Toolbox Overview SLAM Toolbox is the primary SLAM solution used on Titan Robot. It supports: - Online asynchronous mapping - Map serialization - Localization mode using saved maps SLAM Toolbox is preferred due to: - Robust loop closure - ROS 2 native support - Efficient performance on embedded computers Starting Mapping Mode Launch Required Components Ensure the robot is powered on and bringup is running: ros2 launch titan_bringup titan_bringup.launch.py Launch SLAM Toolbox (Mapping Mode) In a new terminal: ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py This starts SLAM Toolbox in online mapping mode .

This section explains how localization and navigation are performed using ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) . Titan Robot relies entirely on Nav2 for: - Localization using a pre-built map - Global and local path planning - Obstacle avoidance - Velocity command generation Localization Concepts What is Localization? Localization is the process of estimating the robot\u2019s pose (x, y, \u03b8) within a known map. Once a map is provided, the robot continuously estimates its position using sensor data and odometry. Nav2 uses a probabilistic localization approach (AMCL) to localize the robot on the map. Inputs Used for Localization Input Source Map Pre-built occupancy grid Laser scans 2D LIDAR ( /scan ) Odometry Encoder-based odometry ( /odom ) TF Coordinate frame transforms Prerequisites Before starting localization and navigation, ensure that: A valid map file (.yaml and .pgm) is available Robot bringup is running LIDAR is publishing scan data Odometry is being published correctly Launching Localization and Navigation Localization and navigation are launched together using Nav2 bringup. Run the following command: ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup.launch.py map:=/absolute/path/to/map.yaml This launch file starts: - Map server - Localization (AMCL) - Global planner - Local controller - Costmaps - Behavior tree navigator Initial Pose Estimation After Nav2 starts, the robot must be given an initial pose.

What should I check first? A: Verify battery voltage, motor power, and ensure the ESP32 firmware is running and connected. Q: Why does the robot drift even when standing still? A: This is usually caused by encoder noise or incorrect PID tuning. Check encoder filtering and reduce control gains. Q: Do I need to remap the environment every time? A: No. As long as the environment and sensor mounting remain unchanged, a saved map can be reused. Q: Can I run RViz2 on my laptop instead of the robot? A: Yes. Running RViz2 remotely is recommended to reduce CPU load on the robot. Q: Why does Nav2 fail to generate a path? A: Common causes include poor localization, incorrect costmap configuration, or an invalid initial pose. Q: Is it safe to run navigation without teleoperation testing? A: No. Always verify basic teleoperation and sensor data before enabling autonomous navigation. Q: Can I add new sensors to the robot? A: Yes. Titan Robot is designed to be modular and supports additional sensors via USB or GPIO. Q: How do I stop the robot immediately in case of an issue? A: Use keyboard teleop to stop motion, power off the motors, or disconnect power if necessary.

This section introduces the primary tools used with Titan Robot to visualize data and debug the ROS 2 system. The main tools covered are: RViz2 rqt tools ROS 2 command-line utilities RViz2 Overview RViz2 is the primary visualization tool used to view the robot\u2019s state, sensor data, and navigation information. With RViz2, you can visualize: Robot model (URDF) Coordinate frames (TF) Laser scan data Odometry Maps Navigation goals and paths RViz2 is typically launched automatically during robot bringup. RViz2 Configuration Fixed Frame Ensure the Fixed Frame is set correctly: Recommended: odom (or map when mapping/localization is active) Incorrect fixed frames are a common source of visualization issues. Common RViz Displays Recommended displays to enable: RobotModel \u2013 Shows the robot URDF TF \u2013 Visualizes coordinate frames LaserScan \u2013 Displays LIDAR data Odometry \u2013 Visualizes robot motion Map \u2013 Shows generated or loaded maps Path \u2013 Displays navigation paths Verifying Sensor Data LIDAR Visualization Add a LaserScan display Topic: /scan Verify that obstacles appear correctly around the robot Ensure scan rotates with the robot frame Camera Visualization (V3) Add an Image display Topic: V2: /camera/image_raw V3: /camera/color/image_raw Confirm image stream updates in real time TF Debugging TF (transform) errors are one of the most common issues in ROS-based systems. Visualizing TF Frames Enable the TF display in RViz2 to: Verify correct frame hierarchy Check transform directions Identify missing or misaligned frames Common frames include: map odom base_link laser camera_link Generating TF Tree ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames This generates a PDF showing the complete TF tree.
