# Hardware Overview

## Overview

This section describes the complete hardware architecture of **Pixel Robot**, including its mechanical structure, compute units, sensors, electronics, and power system.

---

## Hardware Architecture

Pixel Robot follows a layered hardware design:

- **Compute Layer** – Runs high-level ROS 2 software
- **Control Layer** – Handles real-time motor control and odometry
- **Sensor Layer** – Provides perception and environment awareness
- **Power Layer** – Supplies regulated power to all subsystems

Each layer is designed to be independent and modular.
