# Localization & Navigation

## Overview

Localization and navigation allow Titan Robot to estimate its position within a known map and autonomously move to target locations.  
This section explains how localization and navigation are performed using **ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2)**.

Titan Robot relies entirely on Nav2 for:
- Localization using a pre-built map
- Global and local path planning
- Obstacle avoidance

## Localization Concepts

### What is Localization?

Localization is the process of estimating the robot’s pose (x, y, θ) within a known map.  
Once a map is provided, the robot continuously estimates its position using sensor data and odometry.

Nav2 uses a probabilistic localization approach (AMCL) to localize the robot on the map.


### Inputs Used for Localization

| Input | Source |
|-----|------|
| Map | Pre-built occupancy grid |
| Laser scans | 2D LIDAR (`/scan`) |
| Odometry | Encoder-based odometry (`/odom`) |
| TF | Coordinate frame transforms |


## Prerequisites

Before starting localization and navigation, ensure that:

- A valid map file (.yaml and .pgm) is available
- Robot bringup is running
- LIDAR is publishing scan data
- Odometry is being published correctly


## Launching Localization and Navigation

Localization and navigation are launched together using Nav2 bringup.

Run the following command:
```bash
ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup.launch.py map:=/absolute/path/to/map.yaml
```

This launch file starts:
- Map server
- Localization (AMCL)
- Global planner
- Local controller
- Costmaps
- Behavior tree navigator


### Initial Pose Estimation

![goal](images/goal.png)


After Nav2 starts, the robot must be given an initial pose.

In RViz2:

1. Set Fixed Frame to `map`
2. Select the **2D Pose Estimate** tool
3. Click on the robot’s approximate position on the map
4. Set the robot’s orientation

The localization system will converge to the correct pose within a few seconds.



### Verifying Localization

Localization is working correctly if:

- The robot model aligns with the map
- Laser scans match map walls
- Small movements update the pose smoothly
- The pose does not jump unexpectedly

---

## Navigation Overview

Navigation allows the robot to autonomously move to a target pose while avoiding obstacles.

Nav2 handles:
- Global path planning
- Local obstacle avoidance
- Velocity command generation

Velocity commands are published to the `/cmd_vel` topic and sent to the ESP32.

## Planners
### Global Planner Evaluation (Nav2)

This document presents a structured evaluation of different **global planners** available in ROS 2 Nav2.  
The planners are compared using quantitative path metrics and qualitative visual inspection to understand their behavior during navigation.


### Global Planner Overview

A **global planner** is responsible for generating a collision-free path from the robot’s current pose to a goal pose using the global costmap.  
The output of the planner is a discrete sequence of waypoints that the local controller later tracks.

The quality of this path directly affects navigation efficiency, smoothness, and controller performance.

### Planners Evaluated

### NavFn

NavFn is a classical grid-based planner that computes paths using **Dijkstra’s algorithm** over the global costmap.  
It guarantees a cost-optimal solution with respect to the costmap but restricts motion to grid-aligned directions.

Due to this grid constraint, paths often contain sharp turns and unnecessary zig-zag behavior.

### Smac Planner 2D

Smac Planner 2D is a **search-based A\*** planner that uses cost heuristics and motion primitives.  
It expands the state space beyond simple grid neighbors, allowing smoother transitions and more kinematically feasible paths.

The planner balances optimality with execution feasibility, making it well suited for differential-drive robots.

### Theta*

Theta* is an extension of the A* algorithm that enables **any-angle planning** by allowing parent reassignment through line-of-sight checks.  
Instead of being constrained to grid directions, the planner directly connects nodes when a clear path exists.

This typically results in shorter and smoother paths with fewer heading changes.

### Planner Evaluation Metrics

### Path Length

Path length represents the total distance of the global path generated by the planner from the robot’s start position to the goal. The global plan is produced as a sequence of discrete waypoints, and the path length is computed by summing the Euclidean distance between each pair of consecutive waypoints along this path.

This metric provides a direct measure of how efficiently a planner connects the start and goal locations. Shorter path lengths generally indicate more direct routes with fewer detours, which can lead to reduced travel time and lower energy consumption. Longer paths often arise from grid constraints, conservative obstacle avoidance, or limited motion connectivity in the planning algorithm.

While path length alone does not capture how easy the path is to execute, it serves as a fundamental indicator of planner efficiency and is especially useful when comparing different planners under the same map and goal conditions

### Path Smoothness

Path smoothness describes how gradually or abruptly the direction of the planned path changes along its length. In this evaluation, smoothness is computed from the global path published on the /plan topic, which provides the sequence of waypoints generated by the planner.

For each pair of consecutive path segments, the heading angle is calculated using the relative positions of adjacent waypoints. The smoothness value is then obtained by summing the absolute differences between successive heading angles along the path. In simple terms, this measures how much the robot would need to turn as it follows the plan.

Lower smoothness values indicate paths with gentle, continuous turns that are easier for a controller to track. Higher values suggest frequent or sharp direction changes, which can lead to oscillatory motion, increased control effort, or slower execution. Smoothness therefore complements path length by capturing the geometric quality of the path, not just how long it is.

### Replan ID

The replan ID is an index assigned to each new global path generated during navigation. As the robot moves and the planner replans, this index increments sequentially. Tracking metrics against the replan ID allows observation of how path quality evolves as the robot approaches the goal and the remaining path shortens.

### Experimental Results

#### Path Length Comparison

The path length comparison shows a consistent reduction in path length as the robot progresses toward the goal. SmacPlanner 2D generally produces the shortest paths due to its any-angle planning capability, allowing direct connections when line-of-sight exists. Smac Planner 2D follows closely, while NavFn typically generates slightly longer paths because of its grid-aligned expansion.

#### Path Smoothness Comparison

The smoothness comparison reveals that Smac Planner 2D produces the straightest and most consistent paths overall. NavFn follows with moderate smoothness, while Theta* exhibits higher variation due to occasional aggressive shortcuts and line-of-sight connections that introduce sharper angular transitions. This behavior becomes more visible during replanning phases as the robot nears the goal.

### Summary

Theta* produces the shortest paths but shows higher variability in smoothness.

Smac Planner 2D generates the smoothest and most stable paths across replans.

NavFn provides predictable behavior but remains constrained by grid-based motion.

## Controllers

### Local Controller Evaluation (Nav2)

This document presents a structured evaluation of different **local controllers** available in ROS 2 Nav2.  
The controllers are compared using time-based and motion-based metrics to understand how they execute a given global path and drive the robot toward the goal.



### Local Controller Overview

A **local controller** is responsible for converting a global path into real-time velocity commands (`cmd_vel`) that move the robot safely and efficiently.  
While the global planner decides *where* the robot should go, the controller decides *how* the robot should move at each instant.

Controller behavior directly affects motion smoothness, responsiveness, stability, and time to reach the goal.


### Controllers Evaluated

#### Regulated Pure Pursuit (RPP)

RPP is a path-following controller that extends classic Pure Pursuit by adding constraints on speed and curvature based on vehicle limits and obstacle proximity. It computes a steering command by selecting a lookahead point on the global path and regulating linear velocity to respect kinematic limits and safety. Because RPP directly tracks the global path and outputs instantaneous control commands (velocity/steering), it does not generate a separate trajectory over time—there is no need for a local_plan.

![RPP](images/simulation/RPP.gif)


#### Dynamic Window Approach (DWB)

DWB is a local planner that decides how the robot should move over the next short moment. It tries many possible speed and turning options that the robot can safely do, simulates short paths for each option, and scores them based on things like staying close to the global path, avoiding obstacles, and moving toward the goal. The best option is chosen and sent to the robot. Because DWB tests and selects from short simulated paths, it produces a local_plan.

The yellow line coming from robot represents the local_plan trajectory in the GIF below.

### Controller Evaluation Metrics

#### Time to Goal

Time to goal represents the total duration taken by the robot to reach the navigation goal after a navigation request is issued.  
It is measured from the moment the controller begins execution until the goal is reported as reached.

This metric reflects overall controller efficiency, including responsiveness, stability, and interaction with the planner.


#### Instantaneous Speed

Instantaneous speed captures the robot’s linear velocity at each control timestep.  
It is obtained directly from velocity commands (`cmd_vel`) published by the controller, allowing fine-grained observation of motion behavior.

Tracking instantaneous speed over time reveals how aggressively or conservatively a controller drives the robot and how it responds to path curvature and goal proximity.


#### Acceleration

Acceleration is derived from the change in instantaneous speed over time.  
It provides insight into motion smoothness and dynamic stability.

High acceleration spikes indicate abrupt speed changes, which may lead to wheel slip, poor tracking, or uncomfortable motion in real robots.


### Experimental Results

#### Time to Goal Comparison

The time-to-goal results show that Regulated Pure Pursuit consistently reaches the goal faster in this setup due to its direct path-following behavior and minimal hesitation.  
DWB, while robust, tends to take longer due to frequent re-evaluation of trajectories and conservative velocity choices near obstacles.


#### Speed Profile Comparison

The speed profile comparison highlights a clear behavioral difference between the controllers.  
RPP maintains a relatively smooth and stable velocity profile, gradually slowing near turns and the goal.  
DWB shows noticeable fluctuations in speed caused by trajectory switching and critic competition.

### Summary

Regulated Pure Pursuit provides smooth, stable motion with predictable speed behavior and faster goal completion.

Dynamic Window Approach offers strong obstacle awareness and flexibility but introduces speed oscillations and longer execution times.

For structured environments with reliable global paths, RPP delivers superior execution quality, while DWB remains valuable in highly dynamic or cluttered scenarios.
