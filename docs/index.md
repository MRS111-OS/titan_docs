## Overview

![Robot Front](images/1.png)

**Pixel Robot** is a ROS 2–based mobile robot platform designed for learning, experimentation, and real-world robotics development. Built with cost efficiency and modularity in mind, Pixel Robot enables students, researchers, and developers to explore modern robotic concepts such as autonomous navigation, mapping, localization, and robot software architecture using ROS 2.

The platform combines reliable hardware with a flexible software stack, making it suitable for education, prototyping, and research applications. Pixel Robot emphasizes hands-on learning by exposing users to both high-level autonomy and low-level motor control.
