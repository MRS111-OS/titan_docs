# Software Architecture

## Overview

This section describes the complete software architecture of **Titan Robot**, including the ROS 2 system running on the main computer and the firmware running on the microcontroller. The software is designed using a layered approach that cleanly separates high-level autonomy from low-level real-time control.

Titan Robot uses **ROS 2 Humble** for all high-level robot functionality and an **ESP32 microcontroller** programmed using the **Arduino IDE** for motor control and odometry computation.

---

## High-Level Architecture

The software stack is divided into two main layers:

- **High-Level ROS 2 Layer (Raspberry Pi)**
- **Low-Level Firmware Layer (ESP32)**

These layers communicate through a serial interface.

---

## High-Level ROS 2 Layer (Raspberry Pi)

The main computer runs Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble and is responsible for:

- Robot bringup and system coordination
- Mapping and localization
- Autonomous navigation
- Sensor processing
- Visualization and user interaction

### Core ROS 2 Components

#### Robot Bringup
- Launch files initialize:
  - Robot description (URDF)
  - Sensor drivers
  - ESP32 communication node
  - RViz2 configuration

#### Navigation Stack
- Uses ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2)
- Consumes:
  - Odometry data
  - Laser scan data
- Produces:
  - Velocity commands (`/cmd_vel`)

#### SLAM and Localization
- SLAM Toolbox used for:
  - Online mapping
  - Localization using pre-built maps
- Uses laser scans and odometry as inputs

#### Perception (Variant Dependent)
- **V2**: Image pipeline from Pi Camera
- **V3**: RGB-D and depth processing from RealSense camera
- Used for object detection and advanced perception tasks

## Low-Level Firmware Layer (ESP32)

### Firmware Overview

The ESP32 runs custom firmware developed and flashed using the **Arduino IDE**.  
Its primary responsibility is real-time motor control and odometry estimation.

The firmware operates independently from ROS 2 timing constraints, ensuring stable and deterministic motor behavior.

---

## Firmware Responsibilities

The ESP32 firmware performs the following tasks:

- Reads wheel encoder tick counts
- Computes wheel velocities
- Applies PID control to motors
- Computes robot odometry
- Exchanges data with the Raspberry Pi via serial

---

## Odometry Computation

1. Wheel encoders generate tick counts
2. Tick counts are converted to wheel rotation
3. Wheel rotation is used to calculate:
   - Linear displacement
   - Angular displacement
4. Robot pose (`x`, `y`, `θ`) is estimated using differential-drive kinematics
5. Odometry data is sent over serial to the Raspberry Pi

---

## Velocity Command Flow

1. Navigation stack or teleop publishes `/cmd_vel`
2. Raspberry Pi serial node sends velocity commands to ESP32
3. ESP32:
   - Converts velocity commands to wheel targets
   - Runs PID control loop
   - Updates motor PWM outputs

---

## Serial Communication

- Bidirectional serial communication between ESP32 and Raspberry Pi
- Data exchanged:
  - Incoming: linear and angular velocity commands
  - Outgoing: odometry and status information
- Simple, structured protocol for reliability

---

## ROS 2 Odometry Publishing

On the Raspberry Pi:

1. Serial data is received from ESP32
2. Encoder-based odometry is decoded
3. Odometry is published as:
   - `/odom` topic
   - Corresponding TF transforms (`odom → base_link`)

This odometry is then used by:
- SLAM Toolbox
- Navigation Stack
- Visualization tools

---

## Timing and Synchronization

- ESP32 runs control loops at a fixed rate
- Raspberry Pi handles ROS 2 timing
- Time stamps are applied on the ROS 2 side
- Sensor fusion compensates for accumulated odometry error
