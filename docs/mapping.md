# Mapping & SLAM

## Overview

Mapping and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enable Pixel Robot to understand and navigate unknown environments.  
This section explains how to create maps using **SLAM Toolbox**, how mapping works internally, and best practices for generating high-quality maps.

Pixel Robot performs **2D LIDAR-based SLAM** using wheel odometry and laser scan data.

## SLAM Concepts

### What is SLAM?

SLAM allows a robot to:
- Build a map of an unknown environment
- Estimate its own position within that map at the same time

Pixel Robot uses:
- **Laser scans** from the 2D LIDAR
- **Odometry** from wheel encoders

These inputs are fused by SLAM Toolbox to continuously update the map.

---

### Inputs Used for SLAM

| Input | Source |
|-----|------|
| Laser scans | 2D LIDAR (`/scan`) |
| Odometry | ESP32 encoder-based odometry (`/odom`) |
| TF | Robot frame transforms |

---

## SLAM Toolbox Overview

SLAM Toolbox is the primary SLAM solution used on Pixel Robot.

It supports:
- Online asynchronous mapping
- Map serialization
- Localization mode using saved maps

SLAM Toolbox is preferred due to:
- Robust loop closure
- ROS 2 native support
- Efficient performance on embedded computers

## Starting Mapping Mode

### Launch Required Components

Ensure the robot is powered on and bringup is running:
```bash
ros2 launch titan_bringup titan_bringup.launch.py
```

---

### Launch SLAM Toolbox (Mapping Mode)

In a new terminal:

```bash
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py
```


This starts SLAM Toolbox in **online mapping mode**.

## Visualizing the Map in RViz2

In RViz2:

- Set **Fixed Frame** to `map`
- Add the following displays:
  - Map
  - LaserScan
  - TF
  - RobotModel

You should see the map being generated in real time as the robot moves.

## Exploring the Environment

Use keyboard teleoperation to explore:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```


### Mapping Tips

- Move slowly and smoothly
- Avoid rapid rotations
- Ensure overlap between scans
- Cover all reachable areas
- Avoid bumping into obstacles

Good exploration significantly improves map quality.

---

## Saving the Map

Once mapping is complete, save the map using RViz2:

1. In RViz2, click **Panels → Add New Panel**
2. Select **SlamToolboxPlugin**
3. Click **Save Map**
4. Choose a directory and map name

This generates:
- `<map_name>.yaml`
- `<map_name>.pgm`

## Map Files Explained

- **PGM file** – Occupancy grid image
- **YAML file** – Metadata describing:
  - Resolution
  - Origin
  - Map image path

Both files are required for localization and navigation.

## Common Mapping Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Recommended Solution |
|-----|---------------|----------------------|
| Map drift over time | Inaccurate wheel odometry | Calibrate wheel encoders and odometry parameters |
|  | Wheel slip on smooth surfaces | Reduce speed and improve wheel traction |
|  | Fast or abrupt robot motion | Move slowly and avoid sudden turns |
| Poor map quality | Incomplete environment coverage | Ensure full exploration of the area |
|  | Rapid rotations | Rotate slowly to maintain scan alignment |
|  | Sensor noise or vibration | Secure LIDAR mounting and reduce vibration |
| No map visible in RViz | Incorrect fixed frame | Set RViz fixed frame to `map` |
|  | SLAM Toolbox not running | Verify SLAM node is active |
| Broken or distorted walls | Odometry error accumulation | Improve encoder resolution and tuning |
|  | Inconsistent scan overlap | Maintain steady movement with good scan overlap |
| Loop closure failure | Insufficient environmental features | Map areas with distinctive geometry |
|  | Poor revisit alignment | Revisit locations slowly and from similar angles |

## Performance Considerations

- Mapping performance depends on:
  - LIDAR scan rate
  - Odometry accuracy
  - CPU load
- Close unnecessary applications during mapping
- Avoid running heavy perception pipelines simultaneously

## When to Remap

You should create a new map if:
- Environment layout changes significantly
- LIDAR mounting position changes
- Wheel parameters are updated
- Odometry calibration is modified

You have now successfully created a map using Pixel Robot 🚀
